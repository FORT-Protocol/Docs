# FORT: A DeFi Development and Application System with Unlimited Liquidity

## Summary

FORT offers a new paradigm: programming that understands a financial product as a
basic discounted function. Its cost is the cost of invoking that function, much like EVM.
The difference is that the economic relations of the discounted computer are internally
generated. This new paradigm can cover almost all financial products (services) and can
be bought at any time and settled with unlimited liquidity, where no market maker, no
margin, no margin call, and no fear of being unable to settle are required. As long as
the DCU liquidity is sufficient, it is extremely simple to restore the traditional financial market, and its function will be very powerful. Moreover, as the difficult issues of
issuance and settlement are solved, traditional derivatives exchanges can focus on the
secondary market, thus greatly reducing their costs. In addition, FORT can also become
a fundamental consistency variable for building the popular metaverse, with the ability
to traverse different games to lock in economic relationships, which has a very promising
future.
