# FORT: A DeFi Development and Application System with Unlimited Liquidity

---

## Summary

FORT offers a new paradigm: financial products are considered as programming over BDFs. The cost is the expense of calling those functions, just like EVM. The difference is that the economic relations of the discount computer are inherent. The new paradigm can cover almost all financial products (services) which can be bought at any time and settled with unlimited liquidity, where market makers, margin (call), and fear of being unable to settle are not required. As long as the DCU liquidity is sufficient, it would be easy to recreate the traditional financial market. Moreover, as difficulties of issuance and settlement are solved, traditional derivatives exchanges can focus on the secondary market, thus significantly reducing their costs. In addition, FORT can bring the fundamental consistent variables for the metaverse, with the ability to traverse different games to lock in economic relationships. Last but not the least, the omnipotent FORT protocol includes two unique features. First, ILM guarantees infinite liquidity to the system which allows any user can get any size of position at any time. Secondly, FORT allows a complete probability space which extends all risk-return combinations for the product development.
