# FORT: A DeFi Development and Application System with Unlimited Liquidity

---

## Introduction

In the traditional financial market (Centralized Finance), financial intermediaries
are responsible for maintaining the fairness of the trading; they are the deal makers
who help the traders to find the matched counterparties. In other situations, they
are also responsible for pricing the financial products. The financial intermediaries
include diverse exchanges and dealmakers of the loan and asset auction market. Together, they boost the efficiency of financial trading to the extreme. For instance,
driven by high-frequency trading, the exchanges allow the frequencies of their order flow to arrive in nanoseconds. Although the traditional financial market has
improved its efficiency, the credit risk within also increases. The inevitable hosting
problem, as well as the power intervention of the financial intermediary, will raise
the implicit costs of financial transactions. These problems account for the main
reason for developing DeFi. If Alice, a trader, wants to buy/sell some asset, or open a position in centralized financial market, she needs to go to a financial intermediary, centralized exchange in this case.

After Alice filling her required trading in an order table, the exchange will publish her order and find counterparties for her. The diagram of this process is exhibited in Figure 1.

DeFi (or “decentralized finance”) is an umbrella term for financial services on
public blockchains. With DeFi, participants can do most of the things that banks
support, earn interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade assets,
and more, but it’s faster and doesn’t require paperwork or a third party. As with
crypto generally, DeFi is global, peer-to-peer (meaning directly between two people,
not routed through a centralized system), pseudonymous, and open to all.

The first generation of DeFi (DeFi 1.0) projects are based on the traditional approach of order book. For example EtherDelta, the EtherDelta exchange is a cryptocurrency trading platform based on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as ERC20
standard tokens. The exchange was established in Chicago in 2017. The platform
is based on smart contracts, with the help of which all contracts are carried out
inside the website (purchase, sale, withdrawal of funds from the wallet, etc.). Since
every order has been written into a contract, waiting for counterparties, this approach is very inefficient and naturally creates a barrier for improving the liquidity
of the market. The problem of DeFi 1.0 is: 1) the liquidity on the chain cannot be
effectively ensured; 2) finding the final matched counterparties still needs for centralized institutions; 3) once a price deviates from the real value, the gas fee cost
of order adjustment is high. This traditional financial approach is not appropriate
for on-chain applications. We extend our story of Alice: now she tries to trade on
a DeFi 1.0 platform. She can participant in a smart contract which specifies her
request and wait for counterparties to notice her order contract. The diagram of
this process is exhibited in Figure 2.

The second generation of DeFi (DeFi 2.0) introduces Automated Market Maker
(AMM) model, which makes decentralized exchange (DEX, e.g., Uniswap, Sushiswap,
etc.) and lending projects possible. DEXs have improved the liquidity of the DeFi
protocols and allow users to deposit tokens to earn trading fees. Lending projects
(e.g., Aave, Compound, etc.) provide the users a platform to earn from providing liquidity and to borrow.

Projects like MakerDao vitalize DeFi market by allowing
users to generate a kind of decentralized stablecoin, this kind of stablecoin is available to anyone, anywhere, like Dai (generated by MakerDAO) is backed by a surplus
of collateral that has been individually escrowed into audited and publicly viewable
Ethereum smart contracts. DeFi 2.0 led to a raising wave in crypto market in 2020
since DeFi 2.0 projects provided a better solution to the fundamental problem of
DeFi industry: lack of liquidity. With a DeFi 2.0 platform. Alice can directly trade
assets with the asset pools deposited by liquidity providers through participating in
a smart contract. The diagram of this process is exhibited in Figure 3.

However, whether it is AMM or liquidity pools, the solution to the liquidity
problems is at the expense of the liquidity provider’s flexibility: a liquidity provider
needs to fix his own trading strategy and bear the fluctuations of the external market.
Once the price is favorable to the liquidity provider, the counter party trader can opts
to back out of the deal. Once an arbitrage opportunity appears, the arbitragers flock
in and cause impermanent losses to the liquidity providers. The liquidity providers have no choice but hopping that for subsidies from mining and commission or interest
earned can compensate their losses.

Although this asymmetric design temporarily
alleviates the liquidity shortage, but it generates the following consequent problems
in the long run: firstly, a large amount of assets are occupied and deposited in DeFi
protocols while only a small volume of transactions are supported, which results in
resources wasting. Most of the total value locked (TVL) is still rushing to liquidity
mining for profits. In the long term, the lower the capital utilization rate, the greater
the loss of intrinsic value of the DeFi products. Secondly, to the AMM, the core
variables, such as asset price and interest rate, are related to the size of the pool.
When the size is small, it is easy to create arbitrage opportunities by high volume
trading on one hand, and it is difficult to attract many traders and lenders when
the pool is not large enough on the other hand. Moreover, the composability of
DeFi products and liquidity sharing are only at the technical level since the TVL
of various DeFi platforms cannot be shared. This kind of liquidity created at the
expense of sacrificing the liquidity providers’ flexibility is not a perfect idea under the decentralized architecture.

It is better to completely erase this asymmetry between liquidity providers and
other traders, creating a brand new form of Defi 3.0: the system plays the role of the
counterparty to all traders. This idea complies the decentralized spirit. Everyone
is in the same position to “gamble” with the smart contract, whether the underling
asset is Bitcoin, Ethereum or other crypto-assets. The system burns the tokens immediately after any participant pays the system tokens for some financial products,
and mints new tokens to settle the financial products if the participant deserves.
We call this model ILM (Infinite Liquidity Model), and comparing with AMM, we
call the system OMM (Omnipotent Market Maker). It frees us from the traditional
financial trading models and forms a new financial paradigm which not only ensures
composability but also uniforms programmability for all DeFi products within the
same framework.

With Defi 3.0, Alice now can directly trade with the system by participating in a
smart contract. The system will be her counterparty in this situation. The diagram of this process is exhibited in Figure 4.
