# FORT: A DeFi Development and Application System with Unlimited Liquidity

---

## Further Applications

There are many possible applications for FORT to develop in the near future.

### Trading, Price Coins, and Stablecoins
A native asset is actually equal to a price coin (DCU), which is equivalent to splitting an asset into a dynamic price and a fixed settlement unit. This model can only be effectively implemented in a fully decentralized world: the traditional centralized world has the credit risk of cashing out. Thus, trading is equivalent to exchanging DCUs for various price coins or settling out of DCUs with various price coins. Or using the native asset to exchange the corresponding price coin at a ratio of 1 to 1 (which is slightly off due to the price deviation of oracles). By analogy, a stablecoin pegged to a fiat currency such as the US dollar is a USDT price coin.

### Exponential and Logarithmic Coins
A new paradigm is the exponential coin, where the percentage of price fluctuations feeds into the growth of returns in an exponential manner. Compared to leveraged coins, exponential coins have many advantages: no need to close positions, faster growth, interchangeable transfers, free stacking at the same address, etc. For example, when the price doubles, the exponential coin with the e base can grow 7.4 times, and when the price triples, the exponential coin grows 20 times.

### Revenue Swaps
Revenue swaps are cost swaps, as they are all equivalent to discounted of revenue streams.

### Lending
Lending becomes much easier by pledging assets accepted by FORT to receive the corresponding DCUs, repaying them to receive the collateralized asset, and then being liquidated when the liquidation ratio is exceeded, where the core parameters are the liquidation ratio, collateral rate, interest rate, etc.

### Insurance
Based on the characteristics at the end of the event, price insurance can be made to swap the loss with the premium.

### Interest Rate Derivatives
It is possible to design various interest rate derivatives through price information of the base interest rate oracle.

### NFT Applications
It is possible to lock in all economic relationships in on-chain games or NFTs based on DCU, i.e., all game assets can be designed to some probability coins or derivatives above. In this way, its game assets corresponding to NFT can be cashed in FORT, regardless of the existence of that game, thus building a consistent variable in the game world.

### Multi-Party Trading
To design a transaction between two or more participants: A and B can create a contract based on FORT, each paying a certain amount of DCUs at the current moment and receiving the corresponding DCUs in the future so that FORT can participate in the allocation between them, which realizes a multi-player competition and game structure.
