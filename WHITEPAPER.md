## Introduction

Liquidity is the key to on-chain applications. To solve this problem, previously DeFi has
tried the traditional idea of order book and AMM models. However, these models are
not ideal solutions and cannot integrate all financial services into the same protocol and
share the same liquidity, resulting in wasted resources and low performance. This paper
proposes a new model: FORT protocol, which creates the concept of discounted computers and on-chain currency units, and systematically solves the liquidity and uniformity
problem of all DeFi. It can be used for all financial product development and economic
relationship lock-in of off-chain activities.
