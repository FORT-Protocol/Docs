# FORT: A DeFi Development and Application System with Unlimited Liquidity

---

## Abstract

Following the development trend of on-chain applications, liquidity has become the biggest problem for DeFi applications.  The previous DeFi projects have tried to apply the traditional order book method and automated market maker models to solve this problem. However, these methods are not ideal solutions since they cannot integrate all financial services into a single protocol and share the same liquidity, resulting in resource wasting and low performance. This paper proposes a new protocol: FORT, which introduces the concept of discount computers and on-chain decentralized currency units, that can systematically solve the liquidity problem and integrate all financial contracts and derivatives into one protocol. It can be used for transferring all financial instruments, including tools for hedging and other economic relationship lock-ins, to on-chain applications.
